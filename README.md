**Vehicle Care Platform**

## Project Description
The Vehicle Care Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to enhance the vehicle maintenance experience for users. This platform enables users to manage their vehicle servicing needs effectively, providing features such as service details, appointment scheduling, and user reviews. The application is built with a strong emphasis on user experience, security, and functionality, making it an invaluable tool for vehicle owners.

## Design Phase
During the design phase, a user-centric approach was employed to sketch the layout of the application's interface. Key considerations included:

- **Usability**: Ensuring the application is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizing CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to create a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.

## Development Phase
### Frontend Development
- **Framework**: The frontend is built using **React**, enabling a dynamic and interactive user interface.

  - Implemented **React Router** for handling client-side routing, allowing for smooth navigation between different application views.
  - Utilized **Redux** (or the Context API) for managing application-wide state, ensuring consistent data flow throughout the application.
  
### Backend Development
- **Server Setup**: Established a backend using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to create RESTful APIs that handle client requests and responses efficiently.
- **Database**: Integrated **MongoDB** as the database for storing and managing user data, service details, and authentication information.
